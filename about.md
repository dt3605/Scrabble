Scrabble
This is the fourth project of the CS50x course.
The goal is to create a program that simulates a simplified Scrabble game where two players input words and the program determines the winner based on Scrabble scores.

This version has been adapted to run without the CS50 library, so anyone can compile and run it using only a standard C compiler.

What it does

Prompts Player 1 and Player 2 to input their words
Calculates the Scrabble score for each word
Prints which player wins or if there is a tie

How to use

Compile the code with gcc -o scrabble scrabble.c
Run the program with ./scrabble
Enter the words when prompted

About
This project helps practice working with strings, arrays, conditionals, and basic input/output in C.
